  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li> 
    <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li> 
    <li>1 large white onion diced</li> 
    <li>5 cloves garlic minced</li> 
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li> 
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li> 
    <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li> 
    <li>1/2 cup white wine</li> 
    <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li> 
    <li>1/2 cup chopped fresh basil</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li> 
    <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano</li> 
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li> 
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li> 
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley</li> 
    <li>30 ounces ricotta cheese</li> 
    <li>30 ounces ricotta cheese</li> 
    <li>30 ounces ricotta cheese</li> 
    <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>   
    <li>1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li> 
    <li>1 pound thinly sliced mozzarella cheese about 24 slices</li> 
    <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3> 
    <ol> 
      <li>In a large pot over medium heat, add in ground sausage and ground beef. Use a spoon to break up the meat into small pieces. Add in onion and garlic and cook until meat is well browned, stirring constantly. Stir in sugar, fresh basil, fennel, oregano, 1/2 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Pour in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and wine*. Stir well and bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer 1-4 hours, stirring occasionally.</li> 
      <li>Meanwhile, place lasagna noodles into the bottom of a pan. Pour hot tap water directly over the noodles, making sure the pasta is completely immersed in the water. Let them soak for 30 minutes, then drain and discard water.</li> 
      <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and nutmeg. Refrigerate until ready to assemble lasagna.</li> 
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Lightly grease a deep 9x13 pan.</li> 
      <li>To assemble, spread about 1 cup of meat sauce in the bottom of the prepared pan. Place 4 noodles on top. Spread with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/4 of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, then sprinkle with 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Repeat layering two more times to create three complete layers. To finish, place a final layer of pasta, topped with another 1 cup of meat sauce to cover the pasta. Top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li> 
      <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes to allow cheese to brown. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
  <h4>Notes</h4> 
    <p>*The white wine can be replaced with red wine, chicken broth, or beef broth.</p> 
  <h3>Make Ahead Instructions</h3>
    <p>After preparing and assembling your lasagna, you can cover and refrigerate for up to 48 hours before baking. Freezing a lasagna of this size is possible, but will require a very long baking time in order to heat all the way through. </p>
