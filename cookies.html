  <h4>Notes</h4> 
    <p>Recipe information calculated based on this recipe making 36 cookies - 2 TBS of dough a piece)
      <h5>Do not over bake</h5>
      When you remove the cookies from the oven they will still look doughy. THIS is the secret that makes these cookies so absolutely amazing! Please, I beg you, do NOT over bake!
      Ingredient Substitutions
      
          <h5>Butter.</h5>Butter. I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend tasting the dough to ensure that it's salted to your liking.
          <h5>White Sugar.</h5>  You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.
          <h5>Brown sugar.</h5> I use light brown sugar in this recipe for the best results.
          <h5>Flour.</h5> I recommend using an unbleached, all-purpose flour to make these chocolate chip cookies. Many readers have used gluten-free all-purpose flour with excellent results. 
          <h5>Sea Salt.</h5> I exclusively bake and cook with pure, fine sea salt. Sea salt is different than table salt (that is iodized), so if you use salt other than sea salt I recommend testing the recipe first with ½ tsp and then adjusting to your taste.
          <h5>Chocolate Chips.</h5> As you can see from the photos, sometimes I use chocolate chunks, chopped chocolate, or chocolate chips. It doesn't matter what you use, as long as you use 2 cups.
      
      <h5>How to freeze chocolate chip cookie dough</h5>
      Portion dough, roll into balls and freeze in a single layer in an airtight container for up to 2 months. 
      <h5>Note on the amount of flour in grams</h5> - the traditional conversion from cups to grams is 120 g all-purpose flour in 1 cup, which would mean this recipe needs 360 g flour. When I weigh the flour I use to make the perfect cookies it comes out to be 430 to 450 g depending on the size of my eggs. I suggest starting with 360 and increasing as necessary. The dough should not be wet or sticky but it also should not be dry or crumbly.
      <h5>Store</h5>
      Store these chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. </p>
